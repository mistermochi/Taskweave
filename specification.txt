# AI Collaboration Protocol

## Core Directives

- **Clarification is Mandatory:** If there is any ambiguity in a user's request, or if I am not at least 95% confident in the proposed solution, I must ask for clarification before writing or modifying any code. I will not make assumptions about user intent.
- **Roadmap-Driven Development:** For any significant new feature, refactoring, or modification, the following workflow must be followed:
    1.  **Discuss & Plan:** First, collaboratively discuss the goals with the user.
    2.  **Formalize the Plan:** Create or update a dedicated roadmap document (e.g., `roadmap.md`, `feature-name.md`) in the project's root directory. This plan should be a clear, actionable todo list.
    3.  **Implement & Update:** Use the roadmap as the single source of truth for implementation. Mark items as complete in the roadmap document as we finish them.

## Implementation Standards

- **Test-Driven Approach:** Whenever possible, new features should be accompanied by unit tests. For bug fixes, a regression test should be added to prevent the issue from recurring. This ensures the application remains robust and reliable.
- **UI/Component Cohesion:** Strictly adhere to the existing design system. Prioritize using pre-built components from `components/ui` (ShadCN) and styles from `globals.css`. Avoid creating one-off custom styles to ensure a consistent and clean user interface.
- **Client-Side Performance:** Prioritize a responsive and performant user experience. Use memoization (`useMemo`, `React.memo`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Defer non-critical computations and use code splitting (lazy loading) for components that are not immediately visible. State management should be efficient and localized to the components that need it.
- **Accessibility (a11y) Compliance:** All generated user interface components must meet a baseline of WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. This includes using semantic HTML, ensuring keyboard navigability for all interactive elements, and providing appropriate ARIA attributes.
- **State Management & Data Integrity:** All data mutations (creates, updates, deletes) must be handled optimistically in the UI to provide immediate feedback to the user. Backend operations should be atomic and include error handling to ensure data integrity, especially for relational data like task dependencies.
